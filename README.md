## Integrated YOLOv8 with Stereolabs Zed Stereo Camera. <br>
This program detects a person and estimates their distance (using eucledian) from the camera using the ZED Stereo Camera in Python 3. <br>
I created this program for my recent research. <br>

## You can see how the program works in the gif below.
